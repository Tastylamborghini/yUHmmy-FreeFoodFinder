Free Food Finder (Web App)

## 📌 Overview  
This is a personal project to build a web application that helps students at University of Houston (UH) discover free-food events on and around campus. The goal is to streamline the search for giveaways, free meals, and campus-sponsored food events.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (In Progress)  
- Frontend: React (initial setup done)  
- Backend: TBD  
- Features planned: Event listing, filtering by date/location, notifications, map integration  
- GitHub: Repository set up and planning underway  

## 👤 My Role  
- Thought of the Idea
- Sole developer for this project—designing and building the system from the ground up.  
- Set up the initial React codebase and repository infrastructure.  
- Planning to expand backend logic, database integration, and user-friendly UI/UX in the next phases.

## 🔭 Next Steps  
- Implement backend endpoints + database for event data.
- Create and test datascraping methods.
- Build filtering/sorting logic for events and map/location integration.  
- Add user-authentication and push notifications for newly added free-food events.  
- Deploy the app and iterate based on feedback from UH students.

## 💡 Why I’m Doing This  
Students often don’t know when/where free-food events are on campus, however I have consistently found ways to find these events, and will put my gift to use. This app will help people find free food, bring more organizations who offer food to the spotlight, increase the amount of free food on campus due to visibility, and incentivize more free food.
